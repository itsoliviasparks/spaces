## About
An exercise in taking a given design deck and translating it into html & css

## Features
- First time working with responsive design & hamburger menus
- Initial practise in front-end dev skills

## Successes
- I'm very proud of the gallery section & my utilization of the aspect-ratio property
- Effective replication of given design deck

## Areas to improve
- Room to improve types of semantic elements used throughout for improved accessability. Specifically, i've forgotten to implement the main element & could have used an ul instead of div for the gallery section
