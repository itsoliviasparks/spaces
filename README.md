## About
An exercise in taking a given design deck and translating it into html & css

## Features
- My first time working with responsive design & hamburger menus!
- Initial practice in front-end dev skills

## Successes
- I'm very proud of the gallery section & my utilization of the `aspect-ratio property`
- Effective replication of given design deck

## Areas to improve
There is room to improve types of semantic elements used throughout for increased accessability. Specifically, I've forgotten to implement the `main` element & could have used an `ul` instead of a `div` for the gallery section
